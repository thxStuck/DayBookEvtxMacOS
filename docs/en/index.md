# DayBookEvtxMacOS documentation

[Русская версия](../ru/)

DayBookEvtxMacOS is a native macOS app for incident response with Windows event logs (`.evtx`).
It parses a folder of logs (for example `C/Windows/System32/winevt/logs` from a triage collection)
into a case and lets you work with it like a SIEM: fast search, click-to-filter, a timeline,
entities, sessions, processes and detections.

## Features

- **Own EVTX parser** in Swift: every physical chunk, not only the ones listed in the stale file header;
  CRC checks; recovery of deleted records from slack space; copies of one record from the live log,
  shadow copies and slack merged into one event that lists every location.
- **DQL query language** in the style of PDQL/KQL:
  `EventID = 4624 and LogonType in (3, 10) | group by IpAddress`. Queries run as set operations and
  never become SQL.
- **Click-to-filter** on any value in the table, the details and the sidebar.
- **Display time zone**: UTC, a fixed offset or an IANA zone; the case stores time in UTC.
- **Histogram and timeline** with day and gap separators.
- **Logs**: one log at a time, like Windows Event Viewer.
- **Registry of hosts, users and IP addresses** with links, **logon and RDP sessions**,
  **process trees**.
- **Sigma detections**: 2,748 bundled SigmaHQ and Hayabusa rules plus your own rules folder. Every rule
  becomes visible DQL; unsupported rules are listed with the reason.
- **Export** to CSV, CSV for Excel, JSON Lines and XLSX with the time zone, the source file and its
  SHA-256.
- **Transparency**: recovered records, heuristics, limits and skips are always marked.
- Russian and English user interface.

Source logs are only ever read, never modified.

## Quick start

1. Download the app from [Releases](https://github.com/thxStuck/DayBookEvtxMacOS/releases/latest)
   and allow it to open on first launch — see [Installation](install.html).
2. File → New Case from Logs… (⌘N), choose the logs folder and where to save the case.
3. Keep the default import options and click Start Import.
4. In Events, pick a preset in the sidebar or type a query, for example
   `EventID = 4625 | group by IpAddress, TargetUserName`.
5. Right-click a value to filter with = or ≠; click a row to see the event details.
6. Open Detections: the Sigma rules ran automatically after the import.
